     <h4><p className='about' >An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.

It’s tough to imagine daily life without e-commerce. We order food, clothes, and furniture; we register for classes and other online services; we download books, music, and movies; and so much more. E-commerce has taken root and is here to stay.

The term “e-commerce” simply means the sale of goods or services on the internet. In its most basic form, e-commerce involves electronically transferring funds and data between 2 or more parties. This form of business has evolved quite a bit since its beginnings in the electronic data interchange of the 1960s and the inception of online shopping in the 1990s.

In recent years, e-commerce has enjoyed a massive boost from the rise of smartphones, which allow consumers to shop from nearly anywhere.


Accept orders
If you’re running a business that sells a product, your e-commerce site must be able to accept orders from your customers. This process can be more complex than you might expect. For each order, your site will need to: <br />
<ul>
  <li>Record customer information (name, address, etc.)</li>
  <li>Collect customers’ acceptance of your terms of service</li>
  <li>Calculate any applicable taxes</li>
  <li>Apply coupons or discounts</li>
  <li>Generate order and tracking numbers</li>
  <li>Share delivery details</li>
  <li>Process billing information</li>
  <li>Provide access to a payment gateway</li>
</ul>
