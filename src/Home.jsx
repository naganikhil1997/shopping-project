            The advantages of a traditional grocery store come from the known quality of its service. 
            While grocery shopping may not be people’s favorite activity (second-least if one believes the survey 
            in the case) it is an important one, with almost all food and drink in the home dependent on the trip. 
            Should a family run out of, say, milk in the morning it could cause strife especially in a household 
            with cereal-eating young children. Therefore, keeping ‘inventory’ levels up at home is of paramount 
            importance and traditional grocery stores are the accepted way to do it. Online grocers like Webvan 
            can offer the same outcome as a traditional grocer (food in the house) without the inconvenience of 
            shopping and driving. But here’s the rub: most grocery shoppers in 1999 weren’t techies and didn’t 
            necessarily trust Webvan to deliver on time. A very poor and easy to see outcome for a family could 
            be ordering milk from Webvan but it not arriving on time and having to make a trip to the store to get 
            it anyway because the family is out. Webvan and other online grocers face a major marketing/PR battle 
            to impress prospective customers to try the service and a major operational and customer service 
            challenge to keep them.The research indicated some positive and some negative beliefs, which were 
            remarkably congruent across groups. In the minds of consumers, while the concept has advantages of 
            convenience, price and product range, it also has its own set of challenges. The traditional grocery store 
            is a familiar place for many, but it can be a time-consuming and stressful experience for families with young 
            children. Online grocers like Webvan offer convenience and convenience can be a boon for families with 
            young children, but it comes with its own set of challenges. The research also found that consumers.
